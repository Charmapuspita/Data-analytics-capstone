The data for this project comes from the `World Happiness Report`. The `World Happiness Report` is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. 

Over the past years, the `World Happiness Report` has focused on happiness and the community: how happiness has evolved over the past dozen years, with a focus on the technologies, social norms, conflicts, and government policies that have driven those changes.

The results of the analysis could help people and their countries/governments focus their resources and investments on the more significant factors to achieve a higher level of happiness.
